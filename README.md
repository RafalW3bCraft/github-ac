# 📂 GitHub Activity Playground

This repository is a **testing ground** for different projects, experiments, and prototypes.
It serves as a sandbox to explore new ideas, workflows, integrations, and GitHub activity without being tied to a single production-ready project.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

* Act as a **multi-project container** for trials, demos, and proofs of concept.
* Store **temporary code** and project snippets before moving them into dedicated repositories.
* Track **GitHub activity history** across experiments.
* Provide a **safe space for iteration** without affecting mainline production repos.

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
github_activity/
├── project-1/       # First experiment/project
├── project-2/       # Another test project
├── notes/           # Documentation, drafts, and scratch notes
└── README.md        # This file
```

> Each folder represents a **self-contained test project**.
> Finalized or stable projects may later be migrated into standalone repositories.

---

## 🛠 Usage Guidelines

1. Keep each project **organized in its own folder**.
2. Add a minimal `README.md` inside each project folder to describe:

   * Purpose
   * Dependencies
   * How to run/test
3. Use this repo only for **experimentation and tracking**, not for production deployment.
4. Clean up old/unnecessary experiments periodically.

## 📌 Notes

* This repository is **not intended for production code**.
* Think of it as a **sandbox** or **lab environment**.
* Projects here may be incomplete, unstable, or experimental.
